= Add a node to a Pool

Storage manager receives the Node add request. Before sending invite to the node, Storage manager constructs the invite as follows.


[source,text]
----
NodeRequest
    endpoint
    pool_name
    name
    mgr_node_id
    mgr_url
----

Node validates the request and joins to the Pool only if

- Node is not part of another Pool.
- Node is a Storage Manager and not a self join request.

Once it accepts the invite, it generates a token and shares it back to Manager. Node saves Hash of the token.

Manager sends the Token in `Authorization` header while making API calls to that node (Not yet implemented: https://github.com/kadalu/moana/issues/56).
